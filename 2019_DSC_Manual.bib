abstract = {This chapter reviews the basic physics and thermodynamics that govern magnetocaloric materials. The thermodynamics of magnetic materials is discussed by introducing relevant free energy terms together with their microscopic origin leading to a discussion of the sources of entropy that can change in an applied magnetic field. Such entropies account for measurable magnetocaloric effects, especially in the vicinity of magnetic phase transitions. Particular attention is devoted to first order magnetic transitions that involve the coupling of spin, lattice, electronic and anisotropic magneto-crystalline degrees of freedom. The problem of irreversibility and hysteresis, present in magnetocaloric materials with first order phase transitions is discussed in the context of out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics and hysteresis modeling.},
