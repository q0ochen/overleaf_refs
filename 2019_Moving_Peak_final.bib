abstract = {In the present paper, we review the recent research on the physics of magnetocaloric materials aiming to define a coherent theoretical framework in which hysteresis and kinetic effects can be appropriately discussed and interpreted in relation to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We dedicate our efforts to introduce a thermodynamic description of the material, including the out-of-equilibrium aspects which are necessary to understand hysteresis, heat flux avalanches and thermal relaxation effects. In particular we show how intrinsic and extrinsic factors, contributing to define the energy landscape of the system, influence the resulting hysteresis and how different kinetic effects are expected depending on the phase transformation mechanisms, here described either as an out-of-equilibrium domain boundary motion or as a thermally activated process associated to energy barriers. Several applications of the theoretical models are discussed in relation with experiments on La(Fe-Si)13-based compounds and Mn–Bi.},

abstract = {The exchange interaction that gives rise to ordered magnetic states depends upon interatomic spacing. If the lattice is deformable, then a spontaneous distortion of the lattice will occur in the ordered state. We have calculated, in the molecular field approximation, the properties of a system in which the exchange energy dependence is given by Tc=T0[1+$\beta$(v-v0)v0]. Tc is the Curie temperature appropriate to a lattice volume v while v0 is the equilibrium volume in the absence of magnetic interactions. The course of the magnetization with temperature of such a system depends upon the steepness $\beta$ of the exchange interaction dependence on interatomic distance, the compressibility K, and T0. The behavior may be the usual second-order transition to paramagnetism, but it can in fact become a first-order transition with the properties usually associated thereto, e.g., latent heat and discontinuous density change. In the absence of an externally applied pressure, the transition will be of the first order if $\eta$40NkKT0$\beta$2[j(j+1)]2[(2j+1)4-1]>1. In this inequality, N is the number per unit volume of magnetic ions of angular momentum j while k is the Boltzmann constant. We have reviewed the experimental evidence on the nature of the first-order magnetic transition in MnAs. We find that this evidence indicates the transition to be one from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism rather than ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism as has been generally assumed. Application of the theory noted above gives $\eta$=2 for this transition. In addition, we derive a value for the volume strain sensitivity, $\beta$=19 and infer the compressibility to be 2.2×10-12 cm2/d. {\textcopyright} 1962 The American Physical Society.},

Scans at 1 mK/s show that its first order phase transitions are made by multiple heat flux avalanches. Getting very close to the critical point, when the transition becomes of the second order type, the step-like discontinuous behaviour associated with avalanches is smoothed out and the thermal hysteresis disappears. This result is confirmed by magneto-resistivity measurements and allows to obtain accurate values of the temperature hysteresis ($\Delta$Thyst = 0.37 K) at zero external magnetic field and of the critical field (Hc = 1.19 T). The number and magnitude of heat flux avalanches change as the magnetic field strength is increased, showing the interplay between the intrinsic energy barrier between phases and the microstructural disorder of the sample.},

@phdthesis{Bez2016Thesis,
abstract = {This thesis studies the first order phase transitions of the magnetocaloric materials La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 and La(Fe,Mn,Si)13Hz trying to overcome challenges that these materials face when applied in active magnetic regenerators. The study is done through experimental characterization and modelling of the properties of such materials.The experimental characterization of these materials is done through various different methods, such as X-ray diffraction, magnetometry, calorimetry, direct measurements of entropy change, capacitance dilatometry, scanning electron microscopy,energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and magnetocaloric regenerative tests. The magnetic, thermal and structural properties obtained from such measurements are then evaluated through different models, i.e. the Curie-Weiss law, the Bean-Rodbell model, the free electron model and the Debye model.The measured magnetocaloric properties of La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 shows a paradoxical behavior; the material shows features of both a first order phase transition and of a second order one. Identities as shift of the heat capacity peak and an asymmetric growth of of the entropy change with magnetic field would describe this material transition as a first order one. However, the material did not present any signs of intrinsic hysteresis, a feature common in first order transitions. This is attributed to a chemical distribution in this first order phase transition material that can lead to a smearing of the transition and the hysteresis, and such effect is observed through modelling. Moreover, inverse susceptibility measurements showed what could be evidences of magnetic polarons being formed in the paramagnetic phase of the material. The origin of the first order transition seems to be due to the magneto-elastic coupling observed through isothermal magnetostriction and dilatometric measurements. Although the Bean-Rodbell model has described with a good agreement the entropy change, hysteresis, magnetization and heat capacity, it has failed to describe the isothermal magnetostriction. It is suggested that such failure could be related to different factors that might influence constructively to each other:(i) the model assumes localized magnetic moments, while this material presents a double exchange interaction; (ii) the model assumes a temperature and field independent bulk modulus, which literature has shown that is not the case; and (iii) the approximation of the cluster being temperature and field independent is exaggerated and perhaps cannot be taken.A series of La(Fe,Mn,Si)13Hz with slightly changes in the composition is also evaluated here. This material may present a second order phase transition for large content of Mn and Si, which will become a first order one as the Mn and Si content decreases. The material also presents a volume change, which also increases as Mn and Si content decreases, which in return may lead to detrimental mechanical stability of the material during application. The shift of the orderness from second to first order transition is observed through heat capacity, magnetization and entropy change measurements. By measuring bulky particles (with a particle size in the range of 5001000 $\mu$m) of La(Fe,Mn,Si)13Hz with first order phase transition, it was possible to observe very sharp transitions. This is not the case for finer ground particles which show a smooth transition, as if it was second order. Although this behavior has been explained in the literature as an artefact due to the inclusion of defects when grinding the material, here it is proposed a different explanation given the evidences. Firstly, it is argued that the material is brittle and insertion of defects through grinding is unlikely. Secondly, it is observed through entropy change measurements that a bulky particle has a larger entropy change. However, the particle cracks and separates into several particles due to stresses generated during the transition, which are related to the volume change. After this effect, if the entropy change is remeasured it shows very similar behavior to measurements of ground particles. Therefore, the results suggests that defects inserted through grinding is probably not the case. To explain such behavior, in this thesis it is proposed that slightly differences in the composition throughout the sample may lead to a Curie temperature distribution.This in return would lead to different regions of the sample undergoing the transition in different temperatures. However, given the polycrystallinity of the material, the crystallites with different Curie temperatures will be volumetric constrained until enough energy is given to the system and the whole bulky particle undergoes the transition. This explains why bulky particles have a sharp transition and ground particle shave a smoother one; the latter is much less volumetric constrained than the former. An outcome of such behavior is observed as strain development during the phase transition; this strain was calculated applying the Williamson-Hall method.The strain development is much more significant in the ferromagnetic phase than in the paramagnetic one, which is attributed to the weakening of the magnetic interactions as the ferromagnetic phase approach the transition. This is speculated as a decrease of the bulk modulus of the ferromagnetic phase as the temperature increases. The paramagnetic phase, however, is expect to have a relatively constant bulk modulus as there is no magnetic interactions. When observing the microscopy images, they show that cracks are usually somehow connected to a minor La-rich secondary phase observed as inclusions in the grain boundaries. It is argued that this phase is the only brittle and hard phase that does not present a volume change.Therefore the decrease of this phase, however low content it is, could lead to an improvement in the mechanical stability of the material during application. Finally the Bean-Rodbell model is applied to the describe the volumetric behavior observed through X-ray measurements as a function of the temperature. The model describes with good agreement the volume discontinuity across the phase transition, and the superimposed distribution of Curie temperature can describe well the paramagnetic growth as the transition occurs. However, the model over-predicts the thermal hysteresis and under-predicts the shift of the the transition temperature with magnetic field.},

abstract = {Modern society relies on readily available refrigeration. The ideal cooling machine would be a compact, solid state, silent and energy-efficient heat pump that does not require maintenance. Magnetic refrigeration has three prominent advantages compared to compressor-based refrigeration. First, there are no harmful gases involved, second it may be built more compact as the working material is a solid and third magnetic refrigerators generate much less noise. Recently, a new class of magnetic refrigerant materials for room-temperature applications was discovered. These new materials have important advantages over existing magnetic coolants: They exhibit a large magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in conjunction with a magnetic phase transition of first order. This MCE is, larger than that of Gd metal, which is used in the demonstration refrigerators built to explore the potential of this evolving technology. In the present review, we compare the different materials considering both scientific aspects and industrial applicability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A promising magnetocaloric material is La(Fe, Mn, Si)13Hy, where the transition temperature can be controlled through the Mn amount. In this work we use XRD measurements to evaluate the temperature dependence of the unit cell volume with a varying Mn amount. The system is modelled using the Bean-Rodbell model, which is based on the assumption that the spin-lattice coupling depends linearly on the unit cell volume. This coupling is defined by the model parameter $\eta$, where for $\eta$ > 1 the material undergoes a first order transition and for $\eta$ ≤ 1 a second order transition. We superimpose a Gaussian distribution of the transition temperature with a standard deviation $\sigma$ (T0), in order to model the chemical inhomogeneity. Good agreement is obtained between measurements and model with values of $\eta$ ∼ 1.8 and $\sigma$(T0) = 1.0 K.},

We compare the properties extracted by this method with those determined using magnetometry and propose a model-independent parameter that would allow the degree of first-order character to be defined across different families of materials. The microcalorimetry method is sufficiently sensitive to allow observation at temperatures just above the main magnetic transition of an additional peak feature in the low field heat capacity associated with the presence of Mn in these samples. The feature is of magnetic origin but is insensitive to magnetic field, explicable in terms of inhomogeneous occupancy of Mn within the lattice resulting in antiferromagnetic ordered Mn clusters.},

abstract = {In the past 20 years, there has been a surge in research on the magnetocaloric response of materials, due mainly to the possibility of applying this effect for magnetic refrigeration close to room temperature. This review is devoted to the main families of materials suitable for this application and to the procedures proposed to predict their response. Apart from the possible technological applications, we also discuss the use of magnetocaloric characterization to gain fundamental insight into the nature of the underlying phase transition.},

abstract = {The magnetocaloric effect of a magnetic material is characterized by two quantities, the isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change, both of which are functions of temperature and applied magnetic field. We discuss the scaling properties of these quantities close to a second-order phase transition within the context of the theory of critical phenomena. Sufficiently close to the critical temperature of a second-order material, the scaling of the isothermal entropy change will be determined by the critical exponents and will be the same as that of the singular part of the entropy itself. However, this is only true in the critical region near Tc and for small fields; for finite fields, scaling with constant exponents, in general, break down, even at Tc. The field dependence can then be described by field-dependent scaling exponents. We show that the scaling exponents at finite fields are not universal, showing significant variation for models in the same universality class. As regards the adiabatic temperature change, it is not determined exclusively by the singular part of the free energy and its derivatives. We show that the field dependence of the adiabatic temperature change at the critical temperature depends on the nonsingular part of the specific heat. The field dependence can still be fitted to a power-law expression but with nonuniversal exponents, as we show explicitly both within mean-field theory and using the so-called Arrott-Noakes equation of state. Within the framework of the Bean-Rodbell model, we briefly consider the scaling properties of the magnetocaloric effect in first-order materials. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for a widely used phenomenological scaling procedure for magnetocaloric quantities.},

@article{Smith2012,
abstract = {Magnetocaloric materials with a Curie temperature near room temperature have attracted signifi cant interest for some time due to their possible application for high-effi ciency refrigeration devices. This review focuses on a number of key issues of relevance for the characterization, performance and implementation of such materials in actual devices. The phenomenology and fundamental thermodynamics of magnetocaloric materials is discussed, as well as the hysteresis behavior often found in fi rst-order materials. A number of theoretical and experimental approaches and their implications are reviewed. The question of how to evaluate the suitability of a given material for use in a magnetocaloric device is covered in some detail, including a critical assessment of a number of common performance metrics. Of particular interest is which non-magnetocaloric properties need to be considered in this connection. An overview of several important materials classes is given before considering the performance of materials in actual devices. Finally, an outlook on further developments is presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.},

@article{Nielsen2015,
abstract = {An experimental device that can accurately measure the magnetic entropy change, $\Delta$s, as a function of temperature, T, and magnetic field, H, is presented. The magnetic field source is in this case a set of counter-rotating concentric Halbach-type magnets, which produce a highly homogeneous applied field with constant orientation. The field may be varied from 0 to 1.5 T in a continuous way. The temperature stability of the system is controlled to within ±10 mK and the standard range for the current setup is from 230 K to 330 K. The device is under high vacuum and we show that thermal losses to the ambient are negligible in terms of the calorimetric determination of the magnetic entropy change, while the losses cannot be ignored when correcting for the actual sample temperature. We apply the device to two different types of samples; one is commercial grade Gd, i.e., a pure second-order phase transition material, while the other is Gd5Si2Ge2, a first order magnetic phase transition material. We demonstrate the device's ability to fully capture the thermal hysteresis of the latter sample by following appropriate thermal resetting scheme and magnetic resetting scheme.},

@article{Bez2016Strain-Development,
abstract = {We use powder X-ray diffraction to evaluate the temperature dependence of the crystalline properties during the magnetic phase transition of La(Fe,Mn,Si)13Hz as a function of the Fe/Mn/Si ratio. Both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases were observed as peak overlaps in the patterns around the Curie temperature (TC) occurring continuously in a temperature range of about 5 K around TC. Using the Williamson-Hall method, we evaluate the strain developing in the crystallites during the transition and find that it is associated with the growth of the paramagnetic phase as the transition occurs. Based on our measurements and microstructure analyses, we propose that cracking during the phase transition is due to or aggravated by the small content of a La-rich phase.},

abstract = {The magnetic properties and magnetic entropy changes of La(Fe1-xMnx)11.7Si1.3 (x = 0-0.03) have been studied. The Curie temperatures TC decrease monotonously with increasing Mn concentration from 188 to 127 K, and the saturation magnetization $\mu$S decreases from 23.9 $\mu$B/fu to 22.2 $\mu$B/fu respectively, as x increases from 0 to 0.03. The maximal magnetic entropy changes |$\Delta$S|, under a magnetic field change of 0-5 T, are 26.0 J kg-1K-1, 25.7 J kg-1K-1, 20.8 J kg-1K-1 and 17.1 J kg-1K-1 for x = 0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03, respectively. The appearance of negative slopes in the Arrott plots for all samples confirms the occurrence of a first-order field-induced itinerant-electron metamagnetic (IEM) transition. Furthermore, the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of |$\Delta$S| peak, $\delta$TFWHM, increases obviously with increasing Mn content, which results in the decrease of the maximum magnetic entropy change.},

abstract = {Bulk samples of La(Fe, Co, Si) 13 have been prepared by powder metallurgy starting from elemental powders and cast master alloys. After sintering at about 1400 K for a few hours, the samples achieve densities of about 7.2 g/cm 3. For ternary La(Fe 0.893Si 0.107) 13 the magnetic entropy change for a field variation of 16 kOe and the adiabatic temperature change for a field variation of 17 kOe amounts to 21.9 J/kgK and 4.2 K at a temperature of 193 K, respectively. For this composition, the thermal and the field hysteresis were determined to be 2.5 K and 2.2 kOe, respectively. With increasing Si content the hysteresis as well as the entropy change decreases. By increasing the Co content from La(Fe 0.865Co 0.05Si 0,085) 13to La(Fe 0.803Co o.112Si 0.085) 13 the peak temperature of the magnetic entropy change was tailored to the commercial relevant range of 254 K-336 K. The Co-containing samples hardly showed any hysteresis at all. Such powders were pressed in a die and sintered to fully dense blocks of about 23 × 19 × 12 mm. The blocks can be machined by conventional techniques to the shapes required in magnetic refrigeration prototypes. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a numerical model that can simulate a magnetocaloric sample on the grain size level, including magnetostatics, heat transfer, local hysteresis and spatial variation of stoichiometry expressed as a variation in Curie temperature, TC,0. Grain structure of a sample is realised as a number of regions each having a uniform TC,0 and defined through a Voronoi-map. We show that demagnetising effects, caused by a finite sample size, and spatial variation in TC,0 can account for the previously experimentally observed 'virgin' effects in the adiabatic temperature change and isothermal entropy change, respectively and first order reversal effect as a function of temperature. We conclude that even a very little variation in local stoichiometry of less than a percent, corresponding to a standard deviation in TC,0 of $\alpha$TC,0 = 2 K for La(Fe, Si,Mn)13H has a significant impact on the overall properties andhistory dependence of a sample.},
